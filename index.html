              <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
                several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>

              <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus
                and
                disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

            <a>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches
                and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and
                begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
                people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                those
                with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely
                to
                develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                attention.

          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>How does COVID-19 spread?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person
                through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or
                exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
                by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch
                COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
                This
                is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

                WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
                findings. </p>

            <div class="content">
              <p><span>Protection measures for everyone:</span>
                <br><br>
                Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through
                your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of
                COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded
                in
                slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the
                latest news.
                <br><br>
                <span>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
                  precautions:</span>
                <br><br>
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
                water.
                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on
                your hands.
                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may
                contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if
                the
                person coughing has the disease.
                Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus
                to
                your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your
                mouth
                and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
                immediately.
                Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from
                viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
                Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                attention
                and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your
                area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
                facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
                Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading
                widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have
                diabetes,
                heart or lung disease.
                Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

                <br><br><br><br>


                <span>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where
                  COVID-19 is
                  spreading:</span>
                <br><br>
                Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)
                Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache,
                low
                grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to
                have
                someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other
                people.
                Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to
                operate
                more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
                If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to
                a
                respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent
                travel or contact with travelers.
                Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
                facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.</p>
